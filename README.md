# TO-DO / Plan

- [ ] Add sorting and filtering options to the `browse` command
- [ ] Add pagination to `browse` command
- [ ] Add concurrency to the `agg` command so that it can fetch more frequently
- [ ] Add a `search` command that allows for fuzzy searching of posts
- [ ] Add bookmarking or liking posts
- [ ] Add a TUI that allows you to select a post in the terminal and view it in a more readable format (*either in the terminal or open in a browser*)
- [ ] Add an HTTP API (*and authentication/authorization*) that allows other users to interact with the service remotely
- [ ] Write a service manager that keeps the `agg` command running in the background and restarts it if it crashes
